# SpriteCreator
Create sprites for SystemVerilog

# How-To
Use the slider on the right to pick the color you want (I know its pretty much impossible to get precise colors) and 
once you have the color you want selected click on the grid to the left. After you have finished drawing, you can 
download a txt file with all of the colors layed out the way we want them for SystemVerilog use.

# This code is Garbage
I know, I don't know much about webdev *shrug-emoji*
